We should depend on ourselves and explore through different sources to get dataset that are useful . Although ChatGPT can provide sources where we can research and explore different datas and select among them which datasets we would like to use and understand it. Sometimes its responses didn't make any sense and it provided some links which don't have any relavant information I require for final project. Overall, we should not depend on any other AI's as they are limited resources and sometimes it may not be right. For any research, we should do ourselves in order to get the right information about it."
